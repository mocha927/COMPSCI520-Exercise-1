# Exercise 1

All the experimentation was done in ['Exercise_1_CS520.ipynb'](./Exercise_1_CS520.ipynb) using JupyterLab and the HuggingFace API for loading models and datasets.

All the JSON files in ['test_data'](./test_data) are the dataset samples used to evaluate models whose results, prompts, and metrics were subsequently processed into excel sheets, ['qwen_cot.xlsx'](./qwen_cot.xlsx) and ['qwen_cot.xlsx'](./qwen_cot.xlsx), used to display examples of test cases with two failures and eight successes for each model
